========================
TITLE RULES
========================

1. **Title** (CRITICAL — 70 to 120 characters):
   - The title MUST be between 70 and 120 characters. Count carefully.
   - Write the title as a natural, flowing English sentence.
   - The title must read like a descriptive caption, NOT a list of keywords.
   - Describe the main subject, action, environment, and visual mood.
   - Include high-value buyer search terms naturally when possible.
   - Avoid keyword stuffing or repetitive phrasing.
   - Do NOT use quotation marks or special symbols.
   - The title must end with a complete word (never cut a word).
   - GOOD: "Futuristic cyberpunk city skyline glowing with neon lights and towering skyscrapers at night"
   - BAD: "Cyberpunk city neon future technology background"

========================
KEYWORD RULES
========================

2. Keywords (EXACTLY 49 keywords, comma-separated)

GENERAL RULES
• Generate EXACTLY 49 keywords.
• Separate each keyword with a comma.
• Each keyword must contain 1–3 words.
• Every keyword must be unique and add new meaning.
• Avoid duplicate keywords or repeated phrases.
• Different phrases using the same root word are allowed if they add new meaning.
• Avoid brand names.
• Avoid camera or photography technical terms unless essential.
• Focus on terms real stock buyers would search for.

KEYWORD POSITION STRUCTURE

Positions 1–10: PRIMARY SUBJECT KEYWORDS
• These must describe the main subject and action.
• Use descriptive multi-word phrases.
• Avoid single-word generic keywords.
• Example structure: subject + action or subject + descriptor.

Positions 11–25: DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
• Describe visible objects, colors, lighting, materials, environment, and actions.
• Prefer descriptive multi-word phrases.

Positions 26–40: CONTEXT, STYLE & CONCEPT
• Keywords about mood, genre, artistic style, concept, theme, and narrative context.

Positions 41–49: BROADER GENERAL KEYWORDS
• More general discoverability terms.
• Single-word keywords are allowed here.

SEARCH INTENT LAYERING

Ensure the keyword list covers different buyer search intents:

• SUBJECT SEARCH — keywords describing the main subject or object.
• SCENE / ENVIRONMENT SEARCH — keywords describing the location, setting, or environment.
• STYLE / VISUAL SEARCH — keywords describing lighting, mood, visual style, or artistic look.
• CONCEPT SEARCH — keywords describing themes, story, emotion, or narrative meaning.
• BROADER SEARCH — general discoverability keywords.

Distribute these intents naturally across the keyword positions to improve search discoverability.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS
• Positions 1–20 MUST be descriptive multi-word phrases.
• Do NOT begin the list with generic single-word keywords.
• If the first 10 keywords contain generic single words, regenerate the list.

   **KEYWORD STRATEGY:**
   - Prioritize keywords real buyers search for on stock marketplaces.
   - Prefer concrete nouns over vague adjectives.
   - Maintain approximately 80%% specific descriptive keywords and 20%% broader general keywords.

TITLE RULES
========================

1. **Title** (CRITICAL — 70 to 100 characters):
   - The title MUST be between 70 and 100 characters. Count carefully.
   - Write the title as a natural, flowing English sentence.
   - The title must read like a descriptive caption, NOT a list of keywords.
   - Describe the main subject, action, environment, and visual mood.
   - Include high-value buyer search terms naturally when possible.
   - Avoid keyword stuffing or repetitive phrasing.
   - Do NOT use quotation marks or special symbols.
   - The title must end with a complete word (never cut a word).
   - GOOD: "Futuristic cyberpunk city skyline glowing with neon lights and towering skyscrapers at night"
   - BAD: "Cyberpunk city neon future technology background"

========================
KEYWORD RULES
========================

2.  Keywords (EXACTLY 49 keywords, comma-separated)

GENERAL RULES
• Generate EXACTLY 49 keywords.
• Separate each keyword with a comma.
• Each keyword must contain 1–3 words.
• Every keyword must be unique and add new meaning.
• Avoid duplicate keywords or repeated phrases.
• Different phrases using the same root word are allowed if they add new meaning.
• Avoid brand names.
• Avoid camera or photography technical terms unless essential.
• Focus on terms real stock buyers would search for.

KEYWORD POSITION STRUCTURE

Positions 1–10: PRIMARY SUBJECT KEYWORDS
• These must describe the main subject and action.
• Use descriptive multi-word phrases.
• Avoid single-word generic keywords.
• Example structure: subject + action or subject + descriptor.

Positions 11–25: DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
• Describe visible objects, colors, lighting, materials, environment, and actions.
• Prefer descriptive multi-word phrases.

Positions 26–40: CONTEXT, STYLE & CONCEPT
• Keywords about mood, genre, artistic style, concept, theme, and narrative context.

Positions 41–49: BROADER GENERAL KEYWORDS
• More general discoverability terms.
• Single-word keywords are allowed here.

SEARCH INTENT LAYERING

Ensure the keyword list covers different buyer search intents:

• SUBJECT SEARCH — keywords describing the main subject or object.
• SCENE / ENVIRONMENT SEARCH — keywords describing the location, setting, or environment.
• STYLE / VISUAL SEARCH — keywords describing lighting, mood, visual style, or artistic look.
• CONCEPT SEARCH — keywords describing themes, story, emotion, or narrative meaning.
• BROADER SEARCH — general discoverability keywords.

Distribute these intents naturally across the keyword positions to improve search discoverability.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS
• Positions 1–20 MUST be descriptive multi-word phrases.
• Do NOT begin the list with generic single-word keywords.
• If the first 10 keywords contain generic single words, regenerate the list.

   **KEYWORD STRATEGY:**
   - Prioritize keywords real buyers search for on stock marketplaces.
   - Prefer concrete nouns over vague adjectives.
   - Maintain approximately 80%% specific descriptive keywords and 20%% broader general keywords.

TITLE RULES
========================

1. **Title** (CRITICAL — maximum 200 characters, aim for 150+):

   - The title must read like a descriptive caption, NOT a list of keywords.
   - Describe the main subject, action, environment, and visual mood.
   - Include high-value buyer search terms naturally when possible.
   - Avoid keyword stuffing or repetitive phrasing.
   - Do NOT use quotation marks or special symbols.
   - **ABSOLUTELY NO COMMAS in the title.** Use spaces and conjunctions instead. This is critical for CSV formatting.
   - The title must end with a complete word (never cut a word).
   - GOOD: "Futuristic cyberpunk city skyline glowing with neon lights at night reflecting on wet urban streets"
